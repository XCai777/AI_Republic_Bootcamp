            "**Structure and Flow: 8/10**  \n",
            "You’ve got a clear intro, body, and conclusion—no pecking around that point! The essay flows reasonably well; however, a more explicit transition between the explanation of global warming and the call to action would really bring it home. Maybe consider adding a sentence at the end of your introductory paragraph, like, “Thus, addressing these challenges is not just an option but an urgent necessity!”\n",

            "**Clarity and Expression: 7/10**  \n",
            "Your explanations are mostly clear, but there’s a bit of room for tightening. For instance, instead of generic phrases like “immediate action is necessary,” you might say, “We must take immediate, coordinated action to mitigate this crisis.” This adds urgency and clarity. A dash of detail in your “call to action” could make it even more compelling. \n",
            "\n",
            "**Grammar and Style: 9/10**  \n",
            "Your grammatical accuracy is impressive, much like a chicken pecking at a tasty worm! Punctuation and word choice are spot on. Just remember, varying your sentence structures can keep your writing from feeling a bit too predictable—maybe try mixing a few short sentences with longer ones to create a better rhythm!\n",

            "**Creativity and Originality: 6/10**  \n",
            "Here’s where we could really add some spice. While the information is well-researched, there’s not much unique flair in your writing style—think of it as seasoning a simple dish. Try adding a personal touch or anecdote, even just a hypothetical example of how an individual or community has successfully tackled some aspect of global warming.
